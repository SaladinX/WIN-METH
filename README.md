## Description

This repository contains a write-up on the process of exploiting Eternal Blue on Windows 7 64/32 bit. The write-up includes step-by-step instructions and examples, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about cyber security.

As a bonus, the write-up also mocks how my university teaches cyber security to fourth-year students, while I, a fresher, have mastered the art of exploiting Eternal Blue.
